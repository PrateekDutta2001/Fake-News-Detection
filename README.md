# Fake-News-Detection

The advent of the World Wide Web and the rapid adoption of social media platforms (such as Facebook and Twitter) paved the way for information dissemination that has never been witnessed in the human history before. With the current usage of social media platforms, consumers are creating and sharing more information than ever before, some of which are misleading with no relevance to reality. Automated classification of a text article as misinformation or disinformation is a challenging task. Even an expert in a particular domain has to explore multiple aspects before giving a verdict on the truthfulness of an article. In this work, I have use machine learning ensemble approach for automated classification of news articles. The study explores different textual properties that can be used to distinguish fake contents from real. By using those properties, I have train a combination of different machine learning algorithms using various ensemble methods and evaluate their performance on real world datasets.

Machine Learning Algortithms used are:

1. Logistic Regression

2. Random Forest Classifier

3. Decision Tree Classification

4. Gradient Boosting Classifier
